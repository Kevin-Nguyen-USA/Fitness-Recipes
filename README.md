This app is intended to be an app where users can input and share different kinds of workout regiments which include different exercises, number of sets, RPE, etc. Additionally, users will also be able to input and share their workout programs (e.g, Push-Pull-Legs, Upper-Lower body splits, etc.). Development began as part of the MGMT 460 class.
